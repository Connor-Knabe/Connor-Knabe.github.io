    Zen Float Company is the amazing company that created the Zen Float Tent.  They raised $295,000 on
    <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1070936311/zen-float-tent-first-affordable-isolation-tank-for" target="blank">Kickstarter</a>.  This has been an extremely useful tool for myself and my roommates since in the comfort of our own home we can float anytime. I like this company so much that I've even started sponsoring them.  <b>Note</b>: clicking the image above will take you to their site and I get a portion of the sale :)

    The Raspberry Pi Foundation is the awesome company that created the Raspberry Pi.  If you haven't heard of a Raspberry Pi it is basically a small computer about the size of a credit card.  It costs less than $50 and you can interface with all sorts of sensors (motion, temperature, etc).  Recently they released the Pi Zero which is a $5 version of the Pi.

<br>
Trello is an amazing software tool that can help you utilize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban" target="blank">Kanban</a> which is a scheduling system for lean production.  This can be applied to software development, home improvement projects, starting a business, etc.  I've been using Trello for over a year now and it has been extremely useful especially for side coding projects I work on.
