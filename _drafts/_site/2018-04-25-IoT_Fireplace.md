<h2>IoT Fireplace</h2>

I've been asked to share how my IoT fireplace was setup so I decided to turn that knowledge into a blog post. <br><br>

<h3>Summary of why I created this</h3>
I've come to love my gas fireplace.  I don't have a need for heating the whole house as we spend a lot of our time in the living room.  One issue I was having was the need for getting the living room heated before I come home as I don't want to heat up rooms I wouldn't be using.  I decided to take matters into my own hands to make my fireplace connected to the cloud.  It uses a Particle Photon, Relay board, Alexa, and IFTTT.
