<h2>The journey to getting a Zen Float Tent</h2>
I've recently purchased a Zen Float Tent.  Like I have mentioned in my previous <a href="http://www.floatgeek.com/2015/07/Why_I_Chose_The_Zen_Float_Tent/">post</a> there has been much contemplation about getting this tent.  When I first heard about the Kickstarter I was a bit skeptical of the quality and design of the tent.  I was familiar with the Samadhi Tank, Escape Pod, and various pods and rooms all of which are very high build quality.  I decided that I was going to wait until the tent had been used and reviewed before I would purchase one.  This Summer I decided that the Zen Float Tent was right for me and when I was on a drive from Florida to St. Louis while looking on Facebook noticed a post from Jeremy at <a href="http://escapepodtank.com">Escape Pod Tank</a> saying he had one for sale.  Naturally this was the perfect opportunity so I ended up purchasing in the tank from him.








<h2>Summary</h2>
Both years I've been the float conference have been amazing experiences.  I would recommend this conference for anyone who likes floating or the float culture.  I plan on going back next year August 20th-21st 2016 and would love to see more people out there (leave a comment below if you are going to attend)! Every year it seems like more and more people attend and it's really great to see the same people each year.  There is really something special about this industry that revolves around a sense of community and good will for others.  More info can be found on the float conference's website
