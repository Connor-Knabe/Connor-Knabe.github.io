<h2>The journey to getting a Zen Float Tent</h2>
I've recently purchased a Zen Float Tent.  Like I have mentioned in my previous <a href="http://www.floatgeek.com/2015/07/Why_I_Chose_The_Zen_Float_Tent/">post</a> there has been much contemplation about getting this tent.  When I first heard about the Kickstarter I was a bit skeptical of the quality and design of the tent.  I was familiar with the Samadhi Tank, Escape Pod, and various pods and rooms all of which are very high build quality.  I decided that I was going to wait until the tent had been used and reviewed before I would purchase one.  This Summer I decided that the Zen Float Tent was right for me and when I was on a drive from Florida to St. Louis while looking on Facebook noticed a post from Jeremy at <a href="http://escapepodtank.com">Escape Pod Tank</a> saying he had one for sale.  Naturally this was the perfect opportunity so I ended up purchasing in the tent from him.

<h2>Installation of the Zen Float Tent</h2>
Surprisingly the Zen Float Tent was not terribly difficult to setup.  My situation was a bit unique because I custom build a base and a filtration system for the tent but overall it took about a weekend to get it all up and running.

<h3>Platform</h3>
The process started with the base which consisted of six 12"x2" pieces of wood from Lowes.  This would help with absorbing some sound and distribute the weight across the floor.  On top of the wood platform there is a thin piece of plywood to make a smooth surface.  On top of the plywood are three 6'x4' pieces of sound absorbing rubber purchased from <a href="http://www.acousticalsurfaces.com/acoust_flooring/nuetra_phone.htm">Acoustical Surfaces</a>.  This is to ensure that the tent is completely soundproof especially from vibrations traveling through the floor such as door slams and people walking. When the base was complete it covers 12 feet by 6 feet which fit perfectly in the room (even allowing space for a yoga mat).

<h3>Spill Berm</h3>
Then the spill berm was setup on top of this platform.  The spill berm was designed for industrial spills such as for harmful chemicals.  I had one custom made that is white (epsom salt is harder to see on white) and 11'x5' this ensures plenty of space for the 8'x4' tent to fit on there.  Also having this much space allowed me to make the tent go across the wood beams diagonally to keep the weight distributed across multiple beams (5-6 beams instead of 4).

<h3>Water</h3>
After the berm was setup it was time to install the tent which you can see the process in the photos above.  This was a fairly easy process which consisted of placing metal rods into the vinyl and then connecting the pieces.  After all the rods were in place I started filling the tent with reverse osmosis water.  You might wonder why I filled the tent with reverse osmosis water and not just tap water.  I did this because there can be some heavy metals such as iron in the water supply and also chlorine and other chemicals which I don't want in the tent.  

<h3>Epsom Salt</h3>
Finally it was time for the Epsom salt which I purchased from <a href="sfsalt.com/epsom-salt-for-floatation-tanks">Sf Salt Co</a>. They have really good prices on bulk Epsom salt and they also were at the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2015/08/Highlights_From_the_2015_Float_Conference">Float Conference</a> this year.  I ended up purchasing 1,100 lbs from them which arrived on a pallet in individual 50lb bags.  As of this blog post I have around 635lbs of Epsom salt and about 115 gallons of water in the tent.
