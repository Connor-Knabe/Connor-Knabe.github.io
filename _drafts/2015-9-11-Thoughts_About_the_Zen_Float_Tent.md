<h2>The journey to getting a Zen Float Tent</h2>
I've recently purchased a Zen Float Tent.  Like I have mentioned in my previous <a href="http://www.floatgeek.com/2015/07/Why_I_Chose_The_Zen_Float_Tent/">post</a> there has been much contemplation about getting this tent.  When I first heard about the Kickstarter I was a bit skeptical of the quality and design of the tent.  I was familiar with the Samadhi Tank, Escape Pod, and various pods and rooms all of which are very high build quality.  I decided that I was going to wait until the tent had been used and reviewed before I would purchase one.  This Summer I decided that the Zen Float Tent was right for me and when I was on a drive from Florida to St. Louis while looking on Facebook noticed a post from Jeremy at <a href="http://escapepodtank.com">Escape Pod Tank</a> saying he had one for sale.  Naturally this was the perfect opportunity so I ended up purchasing in the tank from him.

<h2>Installation of the Zen Float Tent</h2>
Surprisingly the Zen Float Tent was not terribly difficult to setup.  My situation was a bit unique because I custom build a base and a filtration system for the tent but overall it took about a weekend to get it all up and running.

The process started with the base which consisted of 6 12"x2" pieces of wood from Lowes.  This would help with absorbing some sound and distribute the weight across the floor.  On top of the 12"x2" there is a thin piece of plywood to make a smooth surface.  On top of the plywood are 3 6'x4' pieces of sound absorbing rubber purchased from <a href="http://www.acousticalsurfaces.com/acoust_flooring/nuetra_phone.htm">Acoustical Surfaces</a>.  This is to ensure that the tank is completely soundproof especially from vibrations traveling through the floor such as door slams and people walking.
