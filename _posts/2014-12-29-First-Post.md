This blog is going to be about floating and software development.

You may be wondering what floating is.  I will write a longer blog post about it in detail later.

Floating is the act of using a sensory deprivation/isolation tank in order to remove yourself from all of your senses.

The tank can be used to help people recover from workouts, relax, help with PTSD, addictions, and other mental illnesses.

What a float tank looks like.
