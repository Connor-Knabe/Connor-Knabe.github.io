    <li><b>The float tank can help us reflect on life.</b></li>
    We are constantly connected to our computers, smartphones, and televisions throughout the day. How often do we have to be with ourselves to reflect on life?
    <li><b>Allows you to approach problems from a different perspective.[1]</b></li>
    Because the tank environment is unlike any other experience on earth, it provides a great opportunity to totally focus on a problem at hand without distractions.  
    <li><b>You can learn things faster in the tank.[2]</li></b>
        As talked about in the <i>The Book of Floating</i> by Michael Hutchison there is a phenomena known as superlearning, which allows you to learn things faster than outside of the tank.
    <br>
    <li><b>Float tanks can allow you to achieve a sense of well being[3]</li></b>
        There have been studies that show float tanks can help you live a happier life.  This is probably due to the fact that you are spending time with yourself and this can allow you to deal with problems that may be bothering you.
    <li><b>Can reduce the hormone cortisol</li></b>
        Why is this beneficial? Well, cortisol is known as a stress hormone which is released in response to stress.  If you can lower this hormone it may help you feel less stressed and more relaxed.
