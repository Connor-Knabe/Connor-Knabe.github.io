<p>This post may get a bit technical so if some of this information seems to be a bit boring to you feel free to skip over the technical parts.<br />
The reason for this post is to lay out what will be required to create a fully automated float center and which parts would consume the most amount of time to develop.  Some of the components that will need to be implemented will include Arduinos(microcontrollers), access cards(to get into building), a database(storing user info), Stripe, Paypal(credit card processor), and networking to tie the whole system into the internet.  </p>

<p>We will break down the whole system into 3 different systems. These systems are:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Scheduling/Billing System</li>
    <li>Building security</li>
    <li>Filtration/clean up</li>
</ol>

<h2>Scheduling/Billing System</h2>
<p>This is the system that will be designed around a website that will allow floaters to sign up on the website and schedule floats.<br />
There are already many versions of this type of software developed however one needs to be custom designed to fit in with the automated float center. Some examples include:</p>
