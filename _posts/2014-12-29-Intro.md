## Floating
This blog is going to be about floating and software development.

Floating is the act of using a sensory deprivation/isolation tank in order to remove yourself from all of your senses.
The tank can be used to help people recover from workouts, relax, help with PTSD, addictions, and other mental illnesses.

There are various types of tanks some that are small that look like a bathtub with a roof over them to larger ones that are open and fill the size of a room.

### How it works
The float tank is filled with around 800-1000lbs of Epsom salt which allows the user to float without any effort.  The density of the water is greater than the dead sea which can allow you to completely relax when lying in it.  The temperature of the water is also heated to the same temperature of the skin so you cannot feel where the water ends and the air begins.  Also there is no light and ideally no sound.  Being deprived of all of your senses can put your body into an extremely relaxed state.

## Development
The term "Software Development" has a lot of misconceptions associated with it.  People may hear this term and think about a nerdy kid in his mom's basement programming a website.  Others may think of a scene from The Social Network when they were having a "Hackathon".  When I tell people that I am a developer many of people will give me an ooh/ahh and explain how they have no idea how to code.  With this blog I would like to help debunk the myth that coding is hard.  If you know basic math and logic you can program.  It just takes time to learn these basic concepts but anyone can do it.  Development teaches you how to problem solve and to approach problems from a different perspective.
