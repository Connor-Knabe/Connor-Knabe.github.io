## Floating
This blog is going to be about floating and software development.

Floating is the act of using a sensory deprivation/isolation tank in order to remove yourself from all of your senses.
The tank can be used to help people recover from workouts, relax, help with PTSD, addictions, and other mental illnesses.

There are various types of tanks some that are small that look like a bathtub with a roof over them to larger ones that are open and fill the size of a room.

### How it works
The float tank is filled with around 800-1000lbs of Epsom salt which allows the user to float without any effort.  The density of the water is greater than the dead sea which can allow you to completely relax when lying in it.  The temperature of the water is also heated to the same temperature of the skin so you cannot feel where the water ends and the air begins.  Also there is no light and ideally no sound.  Being deprived of all of your senses can put your body into an extremely relaxed state.
