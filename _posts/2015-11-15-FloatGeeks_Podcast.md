Recently a friend and myself have started a podcast. It's called Float Geeks which is a podcast all about floating.  The whole idea is to interview and chat with people across the industry and really dive deep into why float tanks are so awesome.  We touch on how to hack float tanks, what happens inside the tank, research around floating, and more.

You can see all of the episodes on: <a href="http://floatgeeks.io" target="blank">http://floatgeeks.io</a>

Also we are on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/float-geeks/id1058855632?mt=2" target="blank">iTunes</a> and <a href="http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/float-geeks" target="blank">Stitcher</a>.

Here is the first episode to give you a taste of what to expect in the future.
