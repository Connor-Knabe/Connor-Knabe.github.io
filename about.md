Geeky meditator that loves developing software, self improvement, float tanks, and learning.

### More Information

Self-improvement is my passion. Pushing myself to my limits is something I live by and am constantly working on becoming the best version of myself possible. (learning, goals, good habits, problems, etc.) I enjoy working on programming challeneges especially ones from http://codingbat.com/ Anything outdoors especially involving nature give me a pleasant state of mind.

### Quotes

"If a man loses pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured, or far away." - Henry David Thoreau
