    <h1>Geeky meditator that loves developing software, self improvement, float tanks, and learning.</h1>

    <p>Self-improvement is my passion. Pushing myself to my limits is something I live by and am constantly working on becoming the best version of myself possible. (learning, goals, good habits, problems, etc.) I enjoy working on programming challeneges and working on cool projects where I can learn a new technology or language. Anything outdoors especially involving nature give me a pleasant state of mind.  My latest venture is an automated floatation tank center where I want to create a business that is self sustaining without the need to have a person constantly working to maintain it.</p>
