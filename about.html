    <h1>Geeky meditator that loves developing software, self improvement, float tanks, and learning.</h1>

    <p>Self-improvement is my passion. Pushing myself to my limits is something I live by and am constantly working on becoming the best version of myself possible. (learning, goals, good habits, problems, etc.) I enjoy working on programming challeneges especially ones from http://codingbat.com/ Anything outdoors especially involving nature give me a pleasant state of mind.</p>
