<b> Last edited: 2/14/15 </b>

First off you are probably wondering what I mean by a fully automated float tank center.  Well lets start by looking at what a typical flotation center looks like.  If you are unfamiliar with a float tank center imagine a tanning salon but instead of tanning beds there are float tanks in each room.  Most of the float centers I've been to consist of a front desk where a person will help sign you in and explain the process of how to use the tank.  This typically would go something like this:

<ol>
    <li>Walk into float center(usually after having made an appointment)</li>
    <li>Talk to the person at the front desk</li>
    <li>Typically they will explain how the float works(which might include taking a shower before/after, using ear plugs, and not getting water in your eye)</li>
    <li>Then you shower/float/shower and then you pay the person at the counter unless you paid before</li>
</ol>
