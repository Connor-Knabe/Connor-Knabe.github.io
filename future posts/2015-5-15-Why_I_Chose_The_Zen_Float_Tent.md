title: Why I Chose The Zen Float Tent

This is the Zen Float Tent. I have decided after a long debate to buy this and set it up in my home.

This idea of getting a float tank has been bouncing around in my mind for a couple of years now.  I had thought about the Escape Pod Tank and the Samadhi tank but just couldn't justify the cost.

Three reasons why to choose the Zen Float Tent:

<ol>
    <li>Affordable</li>
    <li>Light weight</li>
    <li>Aesthetically Pleasing</li>
</ol>


Most tanks out there very expensive usually $8,000 or more.  The Escape Pod is an exception to this being around $6,000 for the residential version.  This makes the barrier of entry for owning a float tank in your own home pretty difficult unless you have money to blow.  

Here is what the Escape Pod looks like.

There are some advantages of buying a higher end tank of course like the filtration system typically is of much higher quality than a cheaper tank and that is a big part of the cost.  If you are only using the tank for yourself and a few friends and family members an extensive filtration system is not as important.  

In the case of my setup I will have another filtration system besides the standard one that comes with the Zen Float Tent.  The reason being is that I know many people who are interested in floating and want to make sure the water is very pure for them.


<h4>Custom filtration system:</h4>

Along with this tank I plan on using 35% hydrogen peroxide to help sanitize the water H202 + UV has been studied as an effective way to clean water. See the EPA post about it <a href="http://iaspub.epa.gov/tdb/pages/treatment/treatmentOverview.do?treatmentProcessId=-300168699"/>here.</a> There also have been many studies done on the combination of UV + H202 in disinfecting water which can be found on<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=10&q=h202+and+uv+sanitizing+water&hl=en&as_sdt=0,26"/> Google Scholar.</a>
If your really interested in how this works UV + H202 forms <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl_radical"/>hydroxyl radicals</a>which are often referred to as the "detergents" of the troposphere because they react with many pollutants, often acting as the first step to their removal.  Which would make sense that UV + H202 can disinfect water.

Typically H202 comes in 3% solutions but for the sake of sanitization 35% makes more sense economically.

The Zen Float Tent comes with one filter pump which includes a UV light (note: the new upgraded tent v1.5 includes two pumps). Just to make sure that the water is ultra pure I may end up getting another UV light to attach to the intex pool pump just to have more of those hydroxyl radicals that I mentioned earlier.

<h4>Isolating sound</h4>
Sound isolation is a typical problem with float tanks especially low vibrational sounds such as people walking or cars driving by.  

To solve this issue I plan on purchasing a neoprene rubber anti-vibration pad to help absorb these sounds.
