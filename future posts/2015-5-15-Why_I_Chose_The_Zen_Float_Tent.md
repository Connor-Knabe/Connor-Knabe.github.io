title: Why I Chose The Zen Float Tent

This is the Zen Float Tent. I have decided after a long debate to buy this and set it up in my home.

This idea of getting a float tank has been bouncing around in my mind for a couple of years now.  I had thought about the Escape Pod Tank and the Samadhi tank but just couldn't justify the cost.

Three reasons why to choose the Zen Float Tent:

<ol>
    <li>Affordable</li>
    <li>Light weight</li>
    <li>Aesthetically Pleasing</li>
</ol>


Most tanks out there very expensive usually $8,000 or more.  The Escape Pod is an exception to this being around $6,000 for the residential version.  This makes the barrier of entry for owning a float tank in your own home pretty difficult unless you have money to blow.  

Here is what the Escape Pod looks like.

There are some advantages of buying a higher end tank of course like the filtration system typically is of much higher quality than a cheaper tank and that is a big part of the cost.  If you are only using the tank for yourself and a few friends and family members an extensive filtration system is not as important.  

In the case of my setup I will have another filtration system besides the standard one that comes with the Zen Float Tent.  The reason being is that I know many people who are interested in floating and want to make sure the water is very pure for them.
