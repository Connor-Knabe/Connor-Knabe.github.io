<b> Last edited: 2/15/15 </b>

First off you are probably wondering what I mean by a fully automated float tank center.  Lets start by looking at what a typical flotation center looks like.  If you are unfamiliar with a float tank center imagine a tanning salon but instead of tanning beds there are float tanks in each room.  Most of the float centers I've been to consist of a front desk where a person will help sign you in and explain the process of how to use the tank.  The process would go something like this:

<ol>
    <li>Walk into float center(usually after having made an appointment)</li>
    <li>Talk to the person at the front desk</li>
    <li>Typically they will explain how the float works(which might include taking a shower before/after, using ear plugs, and not getting water in your eye)</li>
    <li>Enter the room you are going to float in</li>
    <li>Then you shower/float/shower(the person will knock on the tank or you will hear music when float is over)<li>
    <li>You pay the person at the front desk</li>
    <li>After you've paid you can relax in the waiting room or leave and enjoy the post float glow</li>
</ol>

    Having a fully automated float center could substantially cut back on the overhead expenses of paying a person to run the front desk.  The process would essentially be the same except for speaking with a person you would go to the room you booked online.  Keep in mind this system is designed for people who have experience floating so they won't need someone to explain details.  This process might go something like this.
    <ol>
        <li>Book a float online and pay with a credit card</li>
        <li>Visit the float center and you will have an access card or a 4 digit PIN that will allow you to get into the building</li>
        <li>You can use the same access card/PIN to access the float room you booked<li>
        <li>Then you shower/float/shower (music will play in your tank when the time is up)</li>
        <li>After the float your free to leave and enjoy the post float glow</li>
    </ol>
